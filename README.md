# HoriseonCompanyWebsite
A straightforward refactor to revamp company site to become more accessible with HTML & CSS and to optimize for search engines. 

## Introduction
This fun project was intended to upgrade the Horiseon site's accessibility. Areas of focus were repairing broken links, adding alt attributes, and restructing to follow semantic order. 

### Technologies 

Basic knowledge of HTML & CSS

### Difficulties 
Researching the requirements needed was a good portion of the time put into this refactor. After getting better clarification from other students, Instructor and other TA's, project became increasingly manageable. I have added notes for each error/update I was able to find for your convenience.
